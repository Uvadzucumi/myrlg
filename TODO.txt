TODO LIST:

- remove check all FOV field for add light in CLevelMap::CalculateMapLight(), need use
  Light->ApplyToFOV(), and check only required fields.
- Change CalculateAllLights() after Door open, need use CalculateNearestLights(changed field_x, changed field_y)
  for best perfomance.
- Display normal field information (current showed debug info, view vector, light strength and etc.)
- Add Animated Woter tiles
- Add tile postprocessing after map generation (add noise tiles), after map changed - viewed new map
  topology.
